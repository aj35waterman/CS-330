Reflection
When I designed my software, I focused on what the program needed to do and how someone would use it. For this project, I started by planning the scene layout, camera movement, and overall structure early, so I wasn’t fighting the design later. 
Thinking through those decisions beforehand made everything easier to build on as the project progressed. This project helped me strengthen my design and development skills, especially in organization and modularity. I learned how important it is to keep 
visual elements consistent and to separate responsibilities in code, like handling textures, lighting, transformations, and camera controls in their own functions or classes. Iteration played a great role because features like lighting and projection switching 
took multiple attempts to get right, and each milestone pushed me to improve what I already had 
instead of starting over. My approach to coding evolved throughout the milestones. At the beginning, I was focused on just getting things to work. By the end, I was more intentional about clean structure, readability, and reusability. Computer science helps me 
reach my goals by giving me the skills to turn ideas into working systems. Computational graphics and visualization taught me how logic, math, and visuals come together in real-world applications, which I can apply in both future coursework and professional work.
